The Project is about a students REPORT CARD of a class where the students personal details and marks uptained by 
the student in a particular exam or the recent exam conducted by that students school. I have used Python and MYSQL 
in the preparation of this project and I have used Tkinter Python Module to use for getting the inputs from the user and
displaying the stored details in the form of report card. I have used MYSQLCONNECTOR for storing the details or
data inputed the user in the form database called 'report_card' which consist of two Tables students_marks and
students_personal_info in which marks of the student will be stored in students_marks Table and students details will be
stored in the students_personal_info Table. 

     This Project will help user to know the performance of the student by the help of report card which will have all the 
subject scores and practicals exams scores of the student. And also the user will be able to view the personal details of
the student in detailed way and in a easy way to access the stored source. This Project will be easier to use and view 
the source wihout any inconvenience.

      The user will not only be inputing and viewing the source of data but also the user will be able to modify the data 
stored.User can also delete the data which they don't want to keep in the table or database.The user will also be able to 
see the data or details of all the student which are inputed or stored by the user into the database report_card in a 
form of a table.

       Thus user will be able input,access and modify the data or details of the student with the help of mysql connection
with python and python tkinter module.
